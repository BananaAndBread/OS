1)first run:

banana_and_bread@yourMummy:~/Documents/OS/week12$ sudo time ./copy /proc/cpuinfo ex3_copied_file.txt

2)with BUF_SIZE=1:

3)WITH SYNC:

banana_and_bread@yourMummy:~/Documents/OS/week12$ sudo time ./copy /proc/cpuinfo ex3_copied_file.txt
0.00user 0.00system 0:00.05elapsed 5%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 1308maxresident)k
0inputs+80outputs (0major+56minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Explanation:

The execution is slower with buffer size 1 than in first-run because it has to look in memory more times than in the first run due to the smaller buffer size.
The executin with sync is slower because we have to wait for the end of each operation:
