Baseline:
Format: 'K frames: hits / misses'
10 frames: 11 / 989
50 frames: 51 / 949

To increase a hit ratio we should put all the same page reference in one place in the input file. We can use sort for this.
This yields next results:
10 frames: 375 / 625
50 frames: 375 / 625
This is the same as with using 1000 frames, which would be ideal, as there are only 1000 numbers in the input file.

To decrease the hit ratio we should put all the same page references at least K unique numbers apart, where K is the number of page frames. This could be achieved using a custom algorithm. Also, we could use random shuffling for that :)
